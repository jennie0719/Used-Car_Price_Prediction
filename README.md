# Used-Car Price Prediction
## Description
From the perspective of used-car buyers, they have to spend some time finding similar cars in the catalog. The process of deciding whether a used car is worth the posted price can be tedious and not standardised. Several features, including odometer state in kilometers, the year the car has been produced, fuel type of the engine etc. can influence the actual worth of a car. From the perspective of a seller, it is also a dilemma to price a used car appropriately. We aimed to achieve our objectives through the use of machine learning models. 
## Prediction Goals
- Effectively predict the price of a used car based on various parameters
- Whether the price is within buyersâ€™ budget
